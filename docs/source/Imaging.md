# RF imaging
we provide two methods for RF imaging: 

**CCP stacking**: a conveonventional method that stacks receiver functions based on their theoretical conversion points in the subsurface.

**Least-squares migration**: an iterative optimization method that uses the least-squares strategy to solve the migration problem.
