# Array Processing

Array data processing techniques are important for improving subsurface imaging of dense seismic nodal array data. Here we provide two methods for array data processing: 

**Radon Transform**: a transform-domain approach to noise suppression that exploits the difference between signal and noise in Radon domain.

**Rank Reduction**: use singular value decomposition to attenuates random noise while retaining dominant singular values that represent true signals.
